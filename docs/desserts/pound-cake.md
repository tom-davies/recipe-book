| All ingredients at room temperature |
| ----------------------------------- |
| 196 grams unsalted butter           |
| 250 grams granulated sugar          |
| 1/2 tsp baking powder               |
| 1/2 tsp kosher salt                 |
| 3 large eggs                        |
| 1 large egg yolk                    |
| 120 grams sour cream                |
| 1 tsp vanilla extract               |
| 187 grams all-purpose flour         |

## Method

1. Set oven to 180Â°C. Grease a 9x5-inch metal loaf pan with butter.
2. Beat the butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt until pale and very fluffy (6-8 minutes) 
    1. Stop once during mixing to scrape down the bowl
3. Beat in the eggs and yolk one at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. 
    1. The batter should look very fluffy, creamy, and emulsified
4. In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and vanilla until lump-free and totally smooth.
5. Add the sour cream and flour in alternating halves
    1. Mix until just incorporated each time, _about 15 seconds_
6. Using a flexible rubber spatula, scrape down the bowl and mix the batter a few times to make sure everything is evenly combined.
7. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and roughly level the batter with the spatula. 
    1. With a butter knife or offset spatula, swirl the knife through the batter to make sure it is evenly distributed into the pan.
    2. Wet a butter knife and use it to slice down the center of the loaf cake (this ensures an even crack right down the middle of the cake).
8. Bake until the crust is deeply browned, the loaf rises and splits, and the cake feels firm and set when you gently press the top, _60 to 70 minutes_
9. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula or butter knife around the sides to loosen. 
10. Tip the cake into your hand, then place on a wire rack to fully cool before slicing.
