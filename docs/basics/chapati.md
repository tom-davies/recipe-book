| --------------------- |
| **140g** white flour  |
| **140g** brown flour  |

| **150ml** warm water  |


## Method

1. Stir together the flours and salt. 
2. Stir in the olive oil and enough water to make a soft dough that is elastic but not sticky.
3. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-10 mins until it is smooth. 
    1. Divide into 10 pieces, or less if you want bigger breads.
4. Heat a frying pan over medium heat until hot, and grease lightly. 
5. Use a floured rolling pin to roll out the balls of dough until very thin like a tortilla.
6. When the pan starts smoking, put a chapati on it. 
    1. Cook until the underside has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook on the other side.
