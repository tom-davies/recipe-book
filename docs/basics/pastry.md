## Method
1. Cut fat into small pieces
2. Rub together fat and flour to make "breadcrumbs"
3. Slowly add water while mixing with a knife or spatula until a soft dough forms
4. For best results, chill in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using

!!! hint
    To make crumble topping, don't add water.
    
    Add 1 part caster sugar for 1 part fat instead.
